Jazz Fest is seven days spread across two weekends. Bringing a crew means sharing incredible music, local food, and one of the best festivals in the world. Here's how to coordinate your group without missing a beat.

---

## Why Bring a Group to Jazz Fest

- **Spread out and cover more stages** — You can't see everything; your crew can
- **Share the experience** — Live music is better together
- **Split costs** — Private houses are way cheaper than hotels during Fest
- **Built-in dinner companions** — New Orleans dining needs reservations
- **Local intelligence** — More people = more discoveries

---

## Step 1: Understand the Festival Structure

### Jazz Fest 2026 Dates

| Weekend | Dates | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Weekend 1 | April 23-27 (Thu-Sun) | Often less crowded, same quality |
| Weekend 2 | April 30 - May 4 (Thu-Sun) | Typically bigger headliners |

The festival runs Thursday-Sunday both weekends, 11am-7pm daily at the Fair Grounds Race Course.

### Which Weekend?

**Weekend 1:**
- Slightly fewer crowds
- Easier restaurant reservations
- Often has legacy acts
- Better for first-timers

**Weekend 2:**
- Bigger headliner announcements
- More crowded
- Local favorites weekend
- The "main event" feel

**Both Weekends:**
- The ultimate experience
- See everything
- Expensive (2x housing, meals, etc.)
- For serious fans

### How Many Days?

| Duration | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| 1-2 days | Quick taste, specific artists |
| 3-4 days (one weekend) | Full experience without burnout |
| 5-7 days (both weekends) | Hardcore fans, music obsessives |

**Our recommendation for groups: One full weekend (Thursday-Sunday).**

---

## Step 2: Tickets Strategy for Groups

### Ticket Types

| Type | Price (approx) | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Single day | $90-95 | Buy for specific days |
| Weekend pass | $325-350 | All 4 days, one weekend |
| VIP | $1,500+ | A/C tents, premium viewing |
| Brass Pass | $3,000+ | All-access, both weekends |

### Group Ticket Strategy

**Option 1: Everyone buys their own**
- Simple, no coordination
- People can pick their days
- Some might skip days

**Option 2: Organizer buys all tickets**
- Ensures everyone has same days
- One transaction
- Collect money upfront

**Buy early.** Single days and weekends sell out. Don't wait for the lineup—commit to dates first.

### Where to Buy

- **Official site:** jazzfest.com
- **Secondary market:** StubHub, SeatGeek (higher prices)
- **Never:** Random sellers, Craigslist, sketchy sites

## Step 3: Accommodations for Groups

### Why Private Houses Win

| Factor | Private House | Hotel |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Sleep 12-20 | One property | 6-10 rooms, different floors |
| Pre-Fest prep | Kitchen, living room | Hotel lobby |
| Post-Fest recovery | Pool, yard | Your small room |
| Cost per person | $100-200/night | $250-400/night (Fest rates) |

### Book Early

**6+ months ahead:** Best selection, best prices
**3-6 months:** Good options remain
**1-3 months:** Slim pickings, premium prices
**Last minute:** Hotels only, at outrageous rates

### Location Strategy

**Near Fair Grounds (Best):**
- Walk to the festival
- No parking/Uber hassle
- Mid-City, Bayou St. John, Gentilly

**French Quarter/CBD:**
- Best for nightlife after
- Need transportation to Fest
- 15-20 min Uber (when available)

**Garden District/Uptown:**
- Beautiful but further
- Need car/Uber every day
- Can work if you have a vehicle

---

## Step 4: Set Up Group Systems

### Communication Hub

**6 months before:** Create group chat
- WhatsApp works best (polls, mixed phones)
- Pin important info
- Use threads if your app supports them

### Money Tracking

**Splitwise is essential.** Set it up Day 1 and add every group expense:
- Housing
- Group meals
- Shared Ubers
- Supplies

Settle up after each day to avoid end-of-trip drama.

### Deposit Schedule

| Payment | When | Amount |
|---------|------|--------|
| Initial deposit | At commitment | $150-200 |
| Tickets | When purchased | Ticket cost |
| Housing balance | 1 month before | Remaining |
| Activity fund | 2 weeks before | $100 for supplies |

---

## Step 5: Assign Crew Roles

### The Essentials

**The Organizer**
- Books housing
- Coordinates tickets
- Manages money
- Creates shared calendar

**The Advance Team**
- Arrives day early
- Stocks house with supplies
- Handles check-in logistics

**The Lineup Captain**
- Studies the schedule
- Creates daily must-see lists
- Tracks set times
- Calls audibles on conflicts

**The Food Coordinator**
- Makes dinner reservations
- Knows the Fest food vendors
- Plans post-Fest meals

**The Navigator**
- Coordinates transportation
- Sets meeting points
- Keeps track of stragglers

---

## Step 6: Festival Day Strategy

### The Daily Routine

```
8:00 AM - Early risers make coffee
9:00 AM - Everyone getting ready
10:00 AM - Breakfast at house or grab something quick
10:30 AM - Head to Fair Grounds (beat the rush)
11:00 AM - Gates open

11:00 AM - 7:00 PM - FESTIVAL TIME
  - Stake out spots for must-see acts
  - Eat festival food for lunch
  - Stay hydrated
  - Rotate between stages
  - Meet at designated spots

7:00 PM - Festival ends
7:30 PM - Meet at exit point
8:00 PM - Head back to house
8:30 PM - Showers, recovery
9:30 PM - Dinner reservations (or house meal)
11:00 PM - Night plans (bars, clubs, live music)
```

### Staying Together (Or Not)

**The smart approach:** Split up intentionally.

Jazz Fest has 12+ stages running simultaneously. You can't see everything. Instead:

1. **Morning meeting:** Everyone shares their must-sees
2. **Pick convergence points:** "Let's all be at Congo Square at 3pm"
3. **Regroup for headliners:** Big acts, whole crew together
4. **Check-in times:** Text in the group chat every few hours

### Communication at the Festival

Phone service is rough with 50,000+ people. Plan for it:
- **Set meeting spots** with specific times
- **Text instead of call** — texts get through
- **Share locations** — Apple/Google location sharing
- **Have a backup plan** — "If we can't connect, meet at [spot] at [time]"

## Step 7: Food Strategy

### Festival Food (Don't Miss)

Jazz Fest food is legendary. Budget time and stomach space for:

| Vendor | What to Get |
|--------|-------------|
| Crawfish Monica | Creamy crawfish pasta |
| Cochon de Lait Po-Boy | Slow-roasted pork sandwich |
| Mango Freeze | Frozen mango drink (essential) |
| Crawfish Bread | Cheesy crawfish-stuffed bread |
| Pheasant, Quail & Andouille Gumbo | The fancy gumbo |
| Softshell Crab Po-Boy | When it's available |
| Sno-balls | Any flavor, stay cool |

**Pro tip:** Eat lunch at the festival, real dinner after.

### Group Dinners

Book NOW. Jazz Fest = packed restaurants.

**Call directly** for groups of 8+:
- Cochon
- Herbsaint
- Compère Lapin
- Pêche
- Marjie's Grill

**Easy group spots:**
- Jacques-Imo's (no reservations, go early)
- Dat Dog (casual, open late)
- Bacchanal Wine (backyard, live music)

---

## Step 8: Transportation

### Getting to Fair Grounds

**From French Quarter/CBD:**
- Uber: $15-25, but surge pricing during Fest
- Rideshare pickup/dropoff areas get crazy—be patient

**From Mid-City:**
- Walk or bike if you're staying nearby
- 15-20 min walk from Bayou St. John area

**Parking:**
- Street parking fills up EARLY
- Paid lots nearby ($20-40/day)
- Honestly not worth driving unless you have to

### Best Approach

Stay within walking distance (1-2 miles) OR accept you'll Uber both ways and budget accordingly.

### Group Uber Strategy

- One person orders all rides
- Split cost on Splitwise
- Uber XL for 6, order two for 12
- Be patient at festival end—everyone's calling at once
